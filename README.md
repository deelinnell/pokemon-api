# pokemon-card-api-search

A project I'm making with a Pokemon card API. Right now you can search for cards by name and the program returns a list of cards with their set information and the option to load an image of the card. I'm planning on adding additional search parameters and revealing more information returned by the API, and probably some way to filter or sort it. So far I've learned a decent amount about how to work with API's. It was a little tricky at first figuring out how to grab the information so I could work with it, but I think I mostly have that figured out.
