# pokemon-card-api-search

A project I'm making with a Pokemon card API. So far you can search by name. I'm planning on adding additional search parameters and revealing more information returned by the API. So far I've learned a decent amount about how to work with API's. It was a little tricky at first figuring out how to grab the information so I could work with it, but I think I mostly have that mostly figured out.
