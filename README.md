A project I'm making with a Pokemon card API. Right now you can search for cards by name and the program returns a list of cards with their set information and the option to load an image of the card. I've added a sidebar with the option to sort by series and set information and will be adding more filtering options in the future. So far I've learned a decent amount about how to work with API's. It was a little tricky at first figuring out how to grab the response data so I could work with it, but I think I mostly have that figured out. All the styling is with plain CSS as well.
